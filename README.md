# Lil-big-man-discord-bot-
Discord bot for insulting you, pick up lines, roasting people and general other junk.   
The main segment of code is attached however not fully complete. This is because I don't want people claiming my work fully as there own so if you want to use it, please use the link below. I added the main code however so that if people would like to use my code as a template or change a command a bit to fit there bot they can! :) I hope you understand.
